No one is aware \r\nof this deposit except me because I personally went with him to the security firm to make this deposit. He did not declare any next \r\nof kin at this deposit.

I will also issue you a power of attorney as his lawyer to make the claim of the deposit as the new \r\nbeneficiary.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk involved, Everything will be done legitimately. This is real and not one of those hoax letters flying over the internet. \r\nAs soon as you receive this deposit, We will share it in 50-50 ratio.\r\n\r\nYour quick response will be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nFrank Mbewa\r\n\r\n","attachments":[]}}
